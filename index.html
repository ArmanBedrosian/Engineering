<h3>Hi, my name is Arman Bedrosian. I am a
freshman that attends CV High School.</h3>

<h3>August 29-31, September 1-2</h3>
<p>I learned how to play around in Tinkercad.
I also learned about lab safety. Another cool thing
I did this week was that I made a blueprint about my
Rube Goldberg machine.</p>
